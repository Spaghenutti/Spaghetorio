## Current state of the mod

This mod is in early alpha. In my current playthrough I can finish the first tier of science packs (about 200h taking it casually). For the recipes unlocked during first tier there are no plans to change anything (except maybe change some ratios). All recipes comming after allready exist, but might not be reachable through tech tree.

I am currently cleaning up the second science tier in tech tree which is the longest and most complex phase in the development. I want to publish my mod now, because I need some help and gather feedback to tune in the balance.

If you have some cool ideas you can give me feedback in the discussions section.

# Spaghetorio

Introducing the **Spaghetorio** mod for Factorio, where your factory is no longer a place of efficiency but a labyrinth of madness!

Say goodbye to simple crafting trees and hello to a world where even the most basic item requires an epic saga of assembly steps. Want to build a express conveyor belt? You'll first need extract copper and zinc for making brass to combine it with rubber to build some dampeners, followed by crafting overcomplicated gearboxes and then you are machining the titanium frames while you are wondering if its rather worth to built the entire factory just with inserters. 

Warning: This mod may lead to sudden outbursts of laughter (probably not), tears of despair (hopefully not), and the realization that you’ve spent three hours just trying to build a coil. Perfect for fans of over-engineering, unnecessary complexity, and anyone who thinks regular Factorio is too straightforward.

Your factory will never be the same... because it’s going to need therapy. Enjoy the chaos!
