    "description": "Spaghetorio is a Factorio mod that trades efficiency for glorious complexity, introducing new items, fluids, buildings and science packs to create absurdly intricate production chains. Even crafting basic items becomes a puzzle involving exotic materials like ultramafic lava and flux capacitors. Currently in early alpha with players just reaching orbit, the mod is open for feedback to help tune balance.",
